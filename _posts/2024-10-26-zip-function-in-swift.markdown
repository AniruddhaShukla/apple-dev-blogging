The `zip` function is a handy tool that lets us combine two sequences into tuples, creating a sequence of pairs.
This is extremely useful when you want to combine or synchronize data that is related to each other in 2 different sequences.

You can use the zip function on anything that conforms to the `Sequence` protocol. Arrays and Dictionaries conform
to `Sequence` protocol.

Letâ€™s take an example where you have two arrays, names and scores, and you want to pair each name with its corresponding score.
{% highlight ruby %}
let names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Doug"]
let scores = [14, 31, 62, 10]
let result = Array(zip(names, scores))
print(result) // Prints [("Alice", 14), ("Bob", 31), ("Charlie", 62), ("Doug", 10)]
{% endhighlight %}


But what happens when the two sequences are not equal? For example, if the `scores` array had only 3 elements and
`names` array had 4 elements. If the two sequences have different lengths, zip will only pair elements up to the length 
of the shorter sequence and ignore any extra elements in the longer sequence.

{% highlight ruby %}
let names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "Doug"]
let scores = [14, 31, 62]
let result = Array(zip(names, scores))

print(result) // Prints [("Alice", 14), ("Bob", 31), ("Charlie", 62)]
{% endhighlight %}

In this case, Doug does not appear in the output because zip stops pairing elements once it reaches the end of the shorter 
array (scores). This feature of zip helps prevent index out-of-bounds errors by safely ignoring any unmatched elements.
